ODE - Perl Bindings to the C physics library ODE

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are the Perl bindings for ODE, an open source, high performance
library for simulating rigid body dynamics. It is fully featured, stable,
mature and platform independent, with advanced joint types and integrated
collision detection with friction. ODE is useful for simulating vehicles,
objects in virtual reality environments and virtual creatures, and is
currently used in many computer games, 3D authoring tools and simulation
tools.
